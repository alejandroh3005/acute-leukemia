## ABSTRACT

**Purpose**: Bone marrow transplantation is a critical treatment for acute leukemia, but patient prognosis varies based on multiple factors. This study aims to analyze survival outcomes following transplantation, identifying baseline characteristics and post-transplant events associated with disease-free survival and relapse risk.

**Methods**: Using data from a multicenter study of 137 patients, we applied survival analysis techniques, including Kaplan-Meier estimation and Cox proportional hazards models, to examine associations between patient/donor characteristics, stage of initial disease, acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), platelet recovery, and disease-free survival.

**Results**: To be completed.

**Discussion**: Our findings provide insights into key prognostic factors affecting survival after transplantation. We assess the potential protective effect of aGVHD, the role of CMV status, and the impact of methotrexate prophylaxis. These results contribute to refining risk stratification and informing clinical decision-making for leukemia patients undergoing transplantation.
